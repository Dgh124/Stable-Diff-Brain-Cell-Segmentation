 # Stable-Diff-Brain-Cell-Segmentation
 This project aims to build a pipeline that feeds generated training data (brain cell scans) into an image segmentation model that can output cell shape, size and positioning. There are two main goals for this project. (1) Train a modified Stable Diffusion model (based on DDPM) to create realistic cell scans. (2) Optimize a U-net based segmentation model to predict grayscale cell body masks.
